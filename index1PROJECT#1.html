         <h1>Why I Am Taking CMP 128</h1>
     <p>Hi, my name is Elias Mason. I live in the Bronx NY. I am a Mathematics major here at Lehman, i would like to minor in education and then go on to teach Math.Im taking CMP 128 not only because i need it for Math academic requirnments, but also because i know we live in a age where everything is becoming more and more digital. As this continues to happen i believe closeley related topicslike computer science and Math will continue to overlapp. Although i dont have any prior coding or programming experience , i know ill gain the basic knowledge here. I plan on earning my bachollors degree here at Lehman, im a sophemore and take pride into putting effort into everything i do.</p>
     <h2>3 Perfect Jobs</h2>
     <p>My ideal career would be a Math teacher,ive always had a easier time with Math and Science so before i decided on that as my number one choice , i considered things like Nutrition and Engineering.
          
          <p>   Another dream of mine is to play Proffesional Basketball </p>
